The pension increase window will open in 2021. "Economic reference" reporters learned that China's urban retirees' pension is about to usher in a "17 consecutive increases."The specific increase plan is in the pipeline and is expected to be released within this month. At the same time, the pension treatment of urban and rural residents is also expected to be increased, and many places have been vigorously promoting it.

The signal of accelerating the reform of the old-age insurance system is also being intensively released. The National overall planning of old-age insurance is on the line, and the individual pension system is also being studied and formulated.

By 2020, China's pension for retirees has achieved "16 consecutive increases." Since 2018, it has maintained an increase of about 5% for three consecutive years. The 2021 government work report proposes to increase the basic pension for retirees. 根据近日国务院关于落实《政府工作报告》重点工作分工的意见，今年将继续提高退休人员养老金，明确由人社部、财政部牵头，4月底前出台相关政策，年内持续推进。

　　对于2021年养老金上涨幅度，业内预计或将保持在5%以内。

　　“经过多年上调，养老金绝对值明显提高，消费物价指数不高，增幅在5%或者略有放缓，绝对数额会明显增加，养老金的购买力稳步提升，不仅能够保证退休生活水平不下降，而且可使养老保险基金更可持续。”中国社科院世界社保研究中心执行研究员张盈华对《经济参考报》记者表示。

　　除了退休人员养老金将稳步提高外，城乡居民养老金也将有所上调。 数据显示，截至2020年末，我国城乡居民基本养老保险的参保人数超过5.42亿人，绝大部分是农村居民。 2020年，各级政府提供城乡居民养老保险补助资金超过3000亿元。 再加上地方财政补贴增长和个人缴费积累，城乡居保人均养老金水平每月已提高至2020年底的170元。
